# 🌍 Week 1 Project – Air Pollution Analysis  

**Theme:** Climate Risk & Disaster Management  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental risks to health and climate. Increasing levels of pollutants like PM2.5, NO₂, and SO₂ directly affect human health, increase disaster risk, and contribute to climate change.  
This project aims to analyze air quality trends across Indian cities, identify pollution hotspots, and provide insights for better climate risk management.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** `city_day.csv` (Daily air quality data of Indian cities)  
- **Attributes:** City, Date, PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, AQI, AQI_Bucket  
- **Size:** ~200k rows  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. Import and clean the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and outliers  
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - City-wise & year-wise pollution trends  
   - Seasonal impact on air quality  
   - AQI distribution across cities  
4. Visualize findings using graphs & charts  
5. Draw conclusions on climate and health risks  

---

## 📈 Results (Expected Outcomes)  
- Identification of cities with highest/lowest air quality  
- Seasonal variation in pollution (e.g., winter vs summer)  
- Correlation between different pollutants  
- Insights for policymakers & disaster management teams  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook
